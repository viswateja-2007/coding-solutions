# Stock Buy and Sell – Max one Transaction Allowed

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an array  **prices[]**  of non-negative integers, representing the prices of the stocks on different days. The task is to find the maximum profit possible by buying and selling the stocks on different days when  **at most one** transaction is allowed. Here one transaction means 1 buy + 1 Sell. If it is not possible to make a profit then  **return 0**.

Note: Stock must be bought before being sold.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: prices[] = [7, 10, 1, 3, 6, 9, 2]
Output: 8
Explanation: You can buy the stock on day 2 at price = 1 and sell it on day 5 at price = 9. Hence, the profit is 8.
```

```
Input: prices[] = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
Output: 0 
Explanation: Here the prices are in decreasing order, hence if we buy any day then we cannot sell it at a greater price. Hence, the answer is 0.

```

```
Input: prices[] = [1, 3, 6, 9, 11]
Output: 10 
Explanation: Since the array is sorted in increasing order, we can make maximum profit by buying at price[0] and selling at price[n-1].
```

 **Constraint:** 
1 ≤  prices.size() ≤  105
0 ≤  prices[i] ≤  104

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int profitMax = 0;
        int profit = 0;
        int buy = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++){
            int sell = prices[i];
            buy = Math.min(buy, sell);
            if(buy < sell){
                profit = sell - buy;
            }
            
            profitMax = Math.max(profit, profitMax);
        }
        
        
        return profitMax;
        
    }
}
```
