# Trapping Rain Water

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

## Problem

Given an array  **arr[]** with non-negative integers representing the height of blocks. If the width of each block is 1, compute how much water can be trapped between the blocks during the rainy season. 

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [3, 0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 2]
Output: 10
Explanation: Total water trapped = 0 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10 units.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [3, 0, 2, 0, 4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Total water trapped = 0 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 0 = 7 units.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 0
Explanation: We cannot trap water as there is no height bound on both sides.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 5, 3, 1, 0, 4]
Output: 9
Explanation: Total water trapped = 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 0 = 9 units.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 < arr.size() < 105
0 < arr[i] < 103

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxWater(int arr[]) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int left = arr[0];
        int right = arr[n - 1];
        int leftMax[] = new int[n];
        int rightMax[] = new int[n];
        
        int vol = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if(arr[i] >= left){
                left = arr[i];
                leftMax[i] = left;
            }
            
            else{
                leftMax[i] = left;
            }
        }
        
        
        for(int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--){
            if(right <= arr[i]){
                right = arr[i];
                rightMax[i] = right;
            }
            
            else{
                rightMax[i] = right;
            }
        }
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            vol += (Math.min(leftMax[i], rightMax[i])) - arr[i];
        }
        
        return vol;
    }
}

```
