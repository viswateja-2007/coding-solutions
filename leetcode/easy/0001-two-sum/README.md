# Two Sum

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return  *indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`*.

You may assume that each input would have  ***exactly *one solution**, and you may not use the* same* element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 2 <= nums.length <= 104
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
- -109 <= target <= 109
- Only one valid answer exists.

 

 **Follow-up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n2)` time complexity?

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int n = nums.length; 
        int sum[] = new int[2];


        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            for(int j = i + 1; j < n; j++){
                if(target == nums[i] + nums[j]){
                     sum[0] = i;
                     sum[1] = j;
                }
            }

        }

        return sum;

    }
}
```
